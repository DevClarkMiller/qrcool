When performing a code review for React code, do not allow excessive complexity in a single component. Specifically, a component should not exceed 150 lines of code, should have a cyclomatic complexity no greater than 10, and should adhere to the single responsibility principle (i.e., avoid handling multiple unrelated concerns).

When performing a code review, suggest improvements on code organization, separation of concerns, and modular design
